# regression-on-an-open-ended-problem
My approach to solving an open ended problem provided to me by the Adobe Data Science team.

This problem was a part the hiring process for a Data Science intern. Here, all that was given to me was a training dataset and a testing dataset. My task was to perform regression on that testing data using the training data for training the model. This is by no means a perfect approach to the question, especially since it didn't get me through the next round. My reason for uploading this approach to Github is to get feedback from the peers on how I can improve my approach.
